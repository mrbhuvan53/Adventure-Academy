      <center>About us</center>
      <b>Back in 2012, I was doing research for a presentation and stumbled upon a big problem.</b>
      India had tons of people with degrees, but companies couldn't find enough qualified workers!<br>
      Graduates were stuck without jobs, while big companies didn't hire them.<br> <br>


      <b>This surprised me, especially considering how many people five in India.</b><br>
      After digging deeper, I discovered a huge gap in skills: only 3 out of 100 people were considered <br>
      "ready" for good jobs. Many ended up stuck in low-paying roles like customer service, while<br>
      countries like the UK and USA zoomed ahead.<br><br>


      <b>I had experience both in business (startups) and teaching (tutoring), and I wanted to <br> use both to help
        young people succeed.</b><br>
      So, after 7 years in the corporate world, I took a leap - I quit my job and started a learning center<br>
      called Adventure Academy.<br><br>


      <b>Adventure Academy isn't just about getting good grades.</b><br>
      We help students develop important skills like problem-solving and thinking critically.We encourage<br>
      them to try new things, learn from their mistakes, and discover what they're good at.<br><br>


      <b>We also have a digital marketing company.</b><br>

      This gives us real-world examples to teach our students, helping them overcome their fears <br>
      and step into the world of possibilities.<br><br>


    </div>
    <div class="blue-box">
      <p class="blue-box-text"> In short Adventure academy is all about empowering students to become confident ,<br>
        skilled individuals who can tackle any challenge!</p>

      </center>
      <b>We see a talent gap in India.</b> People are bursting with ideas and starting ventures, but finding <br>
      skilled teams is a struggle. On the other hand, <b>freshers and career seekers are eager for <br>
        opportunities.</b>They want to jump in and contribute, but lack the skills or the right pla orm to connect<br>
      with the right companies.<br><br>


      <b>Here's where we come in.</b> We're building a <b>bridge to close this gap. </b>We equip passionate<br>
      individuals with the skills they need and connect them with the companies that need them.<br><br>


      Imagine: <b>Confident graduates landing their dream jobs at exciting startups.</b> Imagine innovative <br>
      companies finding the perfect talent to fuel their growth That's what we see in the future, and that's<br>
      what we're working towards every day.<br><br>

          Is DM really for you? Do you enjoy writing, analysis, and creative problem-solving?<br>

          Fancy certificates and year-long courses don’t guarantee a job. Focus on practical skills<br>
          and targeted preparation.<br>

          Job assistance, not guarantees. We'll equip you to fish, not just hand you the fish.<br>

          Forget colorful classrooms and "ex-big™ names. We offer real-world projects,
          case studies, and competitor analysis.<br>

            <b>heir cheats</b><br>
            Bait and switch: Promise the moon, deliver generic tools and endless theory.
            You're left with fancy certificates, not real skills.<br>

            Year-long slogs: Drown you in long, irrelevant courses. By the time you're "qualified,"
            the market has moved on.<br>

            Job guarantee mirage: They wave a magic wand, but reality? A WhatsApp group with random job postings. No
            personalized support, just empty promises.<br>

            All flash, no substance: Fancy offices, big names, colorful brochures. But behind the curtain? Weak training
            and zero career guidance.<br>

            Fake awards: Boast about meaningless trophies, conveniently forgetting they're often paid
            promotions.<br><br>





            <b>Our counterplay</b><br>
            Real-world relevance: We focus on practical skills you'll actually use, not just textbook jargon. Live
            projects,
            case studies, and competitor analysis — get ready to roll up your sleeves!<br>

            Targeted training: No one-size-fits-all here. We assess your strengths and tailor your learning to your
            ideal
            career path. Internships help you discover your passion.<br>

            Job assistance, not guarantees: We equip you with the tools and confidence to land your dream job, not just
            hand
            you a random opening.<br>

            Authenticity, not glitz: We're about substance, not smoke and mirrors. No fancy facades, just honest<br>
            training that delivers results. ”<br>

            Industry-standard prep: Forget generic interview tips. We train you for real-world scenarios, from body
            language
            to answering killer questions.<br><br>




            <b>We’re not here to feed you the fish, we’re teaching you how to fish</b><br>
            We want you to be confident, adaptable, and ready to thrive in the ever-evolving digital landscape<br><br>
